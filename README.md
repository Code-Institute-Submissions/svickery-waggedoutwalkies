[View website in Github Pages](https://github.com/svickery/waggedoutwalkies)

A comprehensive website for a dog walking company based in Warwickshire, Midlands in the UK. The website includes a parallax effect scroll to show pictures of dogs. There is a home page with contact details on, a services & pricing section, a review section and a contact form section. The purpose of the website is to advertise services offered and to get the user to contact the company that owns the website. In turn this hopefully converts the user of the site to a user of the service. 

For a dog walking site, the user of the site has to feel comfort and assurance. When employing somebody to look after your dog, you want to know you can trus them and allow them into your home when you are not there. This is why the parralax effect was used, to create some warmth in seeing pictures of dogs and also the reason that reviews were such an important part of the site. The website addresses not only the 'feel' that a customer needs to have but also the business side of things also. There are clear and concise services offered and the pricing structure is simple and easy to see.
