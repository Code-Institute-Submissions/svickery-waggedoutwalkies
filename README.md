## Dog Walking Site 

[View website in Github Pages](https://github.com/svickery/waggedoutwalkies)

A comprehensive website for a dog walking company based in Warwickshire, Midlands in the UK. The website includes a parallax effect scroll to show pictures of dogs. There is a home page with contact details on, a services & pricing section, a review section and a contact form section. The purpose of the website is to advertise services offered and to get the user to contact the company that owns the website. In turn this hopefully converts the user of the site to a user of the service.
