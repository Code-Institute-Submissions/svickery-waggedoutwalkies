## Dog Walking Site 

[View website in Github Pages](https://github.com/svickery/waggedoutwalkies)

A comprehensive website for a dog walking company based in Warwickshire, Midlands in the UK. The website includes a parallax effect scroll to show pictures of dogs. There is a home page with contact details on, a services & pricing section, a review section and a contact form section. The purpose of the website is to advertise services offered and to get the user to contact the company that owns the website. In turn this hopefully converts the user of the site to a user of the service. 

For a dog walking site, the user of the site has to feel comfort and assurance. When employing somebody to look after your dog, you want to know you can trus them and allow them into your home when you are not there. This is why the parralax effect was used, to create some warmth in seeing pictures of dogs and also the reason that reviews were such an important part of the site. The website addresses not only the 'feel' that a customer needs to have but also the business side of things also. There are clear and concise services offered and the pricing structure is simple and easy to see. 

The business goals of the website are as follows:
 
* Build trust of the website user and potential client
* Provide examples of clients 
* To show a potential client the services offered
* High quality UX to keep the client on the site
* Ensure the layout is simple and not take up unnecessary space

The customer goals of the website are as follows:

## Features

The entire website is one scrolling parallax effect. Therefore there are no need for separate pages. This means that to use the site more efficiently the navigation bar the top of the page was made sticky. This means that wherever you scroll or click on the page, then the navigation bar moves with it and stays at the top. In the scrolling page, their is a hero image on the front page, and images between each other page, which are at a height of 70%, so there is less scrolling time of the site visitor. There are four sections to the page in total. A home page, services page, reviews page and a contact page. There is also a footer, where the social link icons are and copyright information. 

#### Home

The Home page features one large photography covering the entire page. The photo has a callout wrapper over the top of this with a sentence about the services offered and two forms of contact in phone number and email. The name of the company also appears as a header and there is no logo used for the site. 

#### Services and Pricing

The Services and Prices page had 3 cards from bootstrap as it's layout. In these cards it contains the options available to the client: *Dog Walking*, *Puppy Care* and *Dog Sitting*. In each section there is a short description of the service available and then different pricing options below. The navigation bar stays at the top. There is also a paragraph beneath the title of Services and Prices stating that the services are only available in Warwickshire at this time. This is a simple layout with no pictures, so only the information comes through. 


#### Reviews

There is a photograph from the parallax design before the reviews section if using the scrolling effect of the page. With the navigaton bar once again always at the top. Underneath the title there is another card layout design from bootstrap. It gives each review its number, then the quote, the name of the client and what service the client uses from the company. This is a simple layout with no pictures, so only the information comes through. 

#### Contact Us

Once again there is a picture between Reviews section and Contact Us section using the parallax effect. The navigation is again at the top as always. This is just a simple form with a call to action button at the bottom to allow a potential client to send through their query to the service provider. There is a name, email and message section for the form. 

#### Footer

In the footer is copyright information and links to the social media sites. 

#### Possible Future Features

* GDPR compliant pop up screen. 
* A FAQ's section
* Blog from the service provider
